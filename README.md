# 🔐 Hi, I'm Chidie | **Information Security & GRC Manager**

### 🚀 Security Leadership | Compliance Strategy | Risk Governance

As a security leader, I specialize in designing and operationalizing cybersecurity governance programs that are **scalable**, **audit-ready**, and **aligned to business goals**. My work spans the full GRC lifecycle—from policy design to risk assessment, compliance automation, and stakeholder reporting.

I lead initiatives that align with industry frameworks like **NIST SP 800-53**, **NIST CSF**, **ISO/IEC 27001**, **PCI DSS**, and **CIS Controls** to support organizational risk posture and regulatory obligations.

> All documents in this repository are generalized, de-identified, and provided for educational use. They reflect my hands-on leadership experience building defensible security programs from the ground up.
